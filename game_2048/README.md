# Game Jam 1 - 2048

This is a reimagined version of the 2048, built using the Raylib library. Enjoy!

Raylib Features:

Graphics: Utilizes Raylib's drawing functions (DrawCircleV, DrawText, DrawRectangle) for rendering blocks and text. I may also use this to add block movement animations later.

Input: Uses arrow key input for player controls.

Implements a simple game loop (InitGame, UpdateGame, DrawGame) facilitated by Raylib's window and drawing functions.

Uses Raylib's random number generator for block generation.
